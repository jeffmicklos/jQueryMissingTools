#Useful Array and Object functions in Javascript

This repo is called 'jQueryMissingTools' but at this point,
it has nothing to do with jQuery so that needs to change soon.

Also, this lib eats up the name `CollectionTools` in the global
namespace, so that should be rethought. I am hesistent to put
these methods on `Object.prototype` and `Array.prototype` but
they gotta live somewhere and `jQuery` is not the answer.

## Methods:
-    any: just like `.any?` in Ruby
-    size: for detecting an objects size
-    values: retreive an objects values
-    segment: break an array into smaller N sized arrays
-    getNextIndex: gets the next index of an array from any point
-    getPrevIndex: gets the previous index of an array from any point
